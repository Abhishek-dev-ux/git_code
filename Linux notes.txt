LINUX1:
Linux:this Linux in one organization is called as redhat,centos etc 
commands
touch file1 to create a file like 
file1
ls is used to show list of files
to create a file we use cat > file1
aaaa
bbbb
cccc
then we need to comeout of cat command then type control D
we need to type cate file1 it will display what file we have created
aaaa
bbbb
cccc
to create a file we use cat > > file1
one

three
then we need to type cate file1 it will display what file we have created
aaaa

Mkdir dir1 is used to create directory
ls
file1 file2 file3 file4 file5
mkdir is used to makedirectory
mkdir -p d1
rm -r dir1 is filename is used to remove directory
rm  file1 is used to remove the file
pwd is used to show in which page we are  /home/ubuntu
ls -l is used to show total list of files
.(dot)file name is a hidden file
ls -a is used to show hidden files

1.if we want open a file or create a new file
vim filename
2.To edit the file or to enter some data in the file we should go in insert mode
i
3.To save the file and quit
ESC  :wq Enter
4.To quit without saving
ESC  :q! Enter

LINUX2:LS -l is showing the long listing of the file where the metadata is shown.
ls -a is for all
l-is the long listing
t-t is the time stamp
ls -la 0r ls -al,ls -alh,ls -altr 
h- stands for human readable format that output comes under kb,mb,gigabyte
r-is used to reverse the time stamp, we can notice that older files will come to top and newest files will at the bottom
man -this is manual
man -ls
man --help -it will show you the list of commands
Cd -if we want to move from one directory to another directory
sudo apt install tree
tree-command is command which will show you the tree structure
we want to create tree directory-tree d1:it indicates where we are currently present and where you are planning to go
d1-d2-d3-d4-d5
cd d1
ubuntu: d1$ pwd
/home/ubuntu/d1
ubuntu: d1$ cd d2/d3/d4/d5
ubuntu: d1/d2/d3/d4/d5$ pwd
/home/ubuntu/d1/d2/d3/d4/d5
cd .. it will show the parent director of d5 i.e d1/d2/d3/d4
ubuntu: pwd
ubuntu: d1/d2/d3/d4
ubuntu: cd ../.. d1/d2/d3/d4
ubuntu: d1/d2
ubuntu: cd ..
ubuntu:pwd
/home/ubuntu/d1
ubuntu:cd ..
/home/ubuntu/
ubuntu: echo $HOME,it will show the root of the directory
ubuntu:cd /tmp
ubuntu: /tmp# pwd
/tmp
ubuntu: cd ~ it will also takes us to home directory

LINUX3:
create a file cat > file1
one 
two
three
ctrl+D
ubuntu:ls
file1
ubuntu:cp file1 /tmp/file2
ubuntu:cd /tmp
ubuntu:/tmp$ ls
file2
ubuntu:/tmp$

mkdir -p d1/d2/d3/d4
ubuntu: tree d1
ubuntu:touch d1/f1
ubuntu: touch d1/d2/f2
ubuntu: touch tree d1
ubuntu: cp -r d1/tmp r(recursive)
ubuntu: cd/tmp
ubuntu: tmp$ ls
d1
file2
ubuntu:/ tmp$ tree d1
tree structure will be displayed with 4 directories and 2 files
ubuntu:tmp$ cd
ubuntu: ls
d1 file1
Here cut paste work is done ubuntu:mv file1/tmp
ubuntu: ls
d1
ubuntu: cd /tmp
ubuntu: /tmp$ ls
d1
file1
file2
ubuntu:/tmp$
Move command will perform rename action ubuntu:/tmp$ mv file1 file10
ubuntu:/tmp$ ls
d1
file10(file1 got renamed to file10)
file2
move(mv) is cut paste
copy(CP)is copy paste
soft link
ln -s (ln it is used to create a link)(s is a soft link)
ln -s file1 file2
d1 file1 file2
if we type cat file1 or cat file2 same files and output will be displayed
if we delete file1, file2 will not show any data because file1 and file2 both are same
Hard link
rm file1
d1 file2
rm file2
ls
Jenkins.war(no suvh files or directories)
cat > file1
one
two
three
CLTR D
ls
file1
ls file1 file2
file1 file2
here in hard link when we delete file1 we can access and see data in file2 that is the difference b/w hard link and soft link.the same way copy command will also do the same thing when we copy and delete file1 it will show the data in file2.
cat
ln file1 file2
cp file1 file3
ls
file1 file2 file3

Hard link is the replica of the file whatever changes your making in the file will be replicated in that file
cat file3
one 
two
three

ls -l
total list of files:8
for copied file it will come with same inode number
where as in copy file whatever data present in the previous file will be displayed later whatever changes made cannot be shown
touch: if you don't want to store any data in file we can go with touch command
cat:if you want to store the data in a file and create a file ,you can go with cat command

LINUX4:
cat > file1 is creating a file or overwriting a file 
cat >> file1 is appending a data to the file
cat file1 is used to display the content of the file at the bottom section of the file
less file1 is used to display the content of the file page by page we can navigate up and down and page by page
head file1 is used to show top 10 lines of the file,if want only 3 lines then head -3 file1.
tail file1 is used to show bottom 10 lines of the file,if want only  bottom 2 lines then tail -2 file1.
grep one file1 will display when there is something like one present in any of the lines.grep -n one file1 will display in which line it is present.
grep -v one file1 means reverse search where one is not present in lines like
grep -nv one file1 other than the lines where the one is displayed it should display all the lines when we type the command 
cut is used to cut the data in column fashion
cat > file1
jenkins bamboo gitlab
docker swarm kubernetes
git ansible terraform
cltrl D
ubuntu: cut -d " " -f 1,3 file1(d is delimiter f is field)
jenkins gitlab
docker kubernetes
git terraform

WC is used to show the word count, no.of words,no.of lines,no.of characters which are present in a file.
wc file1,
3 9 68 file1
there are 3 lines,9 words,68 characters in a file
if we want only count of lines wc -l file1
3 file1
if we want only count of lines wc -w file1
9 file1
if we want only count of lines wc -c file1
68 file1

The above all commands like less,head,grep,wc,cut tail,etc re text processing tools)
Redirection and pipeing
all the data is present in cd /dev
what ever we typing through keyboard,hardware command ,s/w command all are considered as files on monitor and whne type ls -l file1 now all the data is not shown on monitor it is shown is file1
the data is not shown directly on screen then we should type ls -l file1
then the data will be displayed in cat file1
total 91184
all the data is displayed in rows.
cal command will show the current month calender
In Linux multiple commands can be executed in one line with semi column date;cal
date;cal > file1 the data in date command which is before ; that info will come on screen and cal and file info will be displayed in file1
(date;cal) > file1 all the data is displayed in file1 now because paranthesis.
if you want to store error msg in file use greater than symbol mkdir d1/d2/d3 2> file1
(data;cal) > file1
data and cal info will come in file1 and > means error info will be displayed on screen
>(greater than is used to save only output in the file)output redirectional
2>(if we want to save error into the file)error redirectional
&>(if we ant to store error and output give ampasent and greaterthan)redirection of both
LINUX5:
pipeing :the output of one command becomes the input of other commands.
ls - la will show the output of the command
if this output we need to store in a file then ls - la > file1
cat file1
|(pipeline)ls -la | wc - l
total lines:200
head -5 /etc/passwd(head command will display the top 5 lines)
tail command(tail command will display the bottom lines head -5 /etc/passwd | tail -1) 
head -15 /etc/passwd | tail -10(line no from 6 to 15 is captured)
head -15 /etc/passwd | tail -10 | grep spool (here head command is showing top 15 lines and the o/p is showing in tail i.e tail command is showing bottom 10 lines and grep is showing only spoof related lines)(|pipeline will take the command to any extent.)
ubuntu@ip-172-31-82-114:~$ head -15 /etc/passwd | tail -10 | grep spool |cut -d ":" -f 1,7(it will leave the data from : and shows remaining data)
if 1st character comes as   -rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1016 Oct  4 19:18 file1 (-)then it is an ordinary file 
if 1st character comes as   drw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1016 Oct  4 19:18 file1 (d)then it is an directory
if 1st character comes as   lrw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1016 Oct  4 19:18 file1 (l)then it is an softlink file
-rw-rw-r-- 1 (owner is having read and write permission and not having execute permissions)-4+2+1=7
-rw-rw-r-- 1 (group is having read and write permission and not having execute permissions)4+1=5
-rw-rw-r-- 1 (other is having only read permissions not having write and execute permissions)0
so all permissions are chmod 750 file1
these permissions can be changed in 2 ways one is numerical and another is alphabetical )
r(read)-4,w(write)-2,X(execute)-1chmod 750 file1
chmod command is used to modify the permissions

chmod 750 file1
-rwxr-x--- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1016 Oct  4 19:18 file1(rwxr is owner having all permissions 4+2+1,group having, r-x--- 4+1, 1 other having 0)
chmod files not only works on files it will work on directories
chmod will work on parent directories 
chmod command will create the chain of directories
